rules:
- Self-Contained Module
	- everything to do with this moduole is in this module
	- no gloabal variables
	- if a module manages more than one thing it should be split up
-seperation of concerns
- DRY code: Don't Repeat Yourself
- efficient DOM usage
	- very few $(selections)
- no memory leaks
	- all events an be unbound


//object literal notation

var myModule = {
	name:'kyle';
	age: '27';
	sayName: function() {
		alert(this.name);
	}
	setName: function (newName) {
		 this.name = newName;
	}
};
myModule.sayName();
